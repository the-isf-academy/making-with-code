# Unit 01 Data Science Project

The final project for this unit will be a research project. Working with the data science tools we explored this unit, **you are expected to tell a narrative story about a time in your life using data as evidence.** 

To be successful in this project, you should **find a topic that is both interesting to you and answerable** (at least in part) with data from your chosen dataset. Your teachers will help you make sure your project hypothesis achieves that. 

ðŸ“– **Here is the [example project juptyer notebook file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z8G28pkMbBF50Qi-DMiugX4q5rJHJJ7S/view?usp=sharing)**.

## [1] Timeline

ðŸ“… **The project begins on 13 February and you will have 4 in-class blocks to complete this project.** 

| section | due date |
|---------|----------|
| cs9.1   | 24 Feb   |
| cs9.2   | 27 Feb   |

## [2] Starter Code

{{< code-action >}} **You can find your project in your Google Drive:** `project_data_science.ipynb`

## [3] Assessment

âœ… **The assessment is broken down into five criteria:**
- Planning  
- Data Analysis
- Data Visualizations 
- Poster
    - Presentation 


For each criteria you will be assigned a score from 0-3:
- 0 - no to no evidence of the concept
- 1 - limited evidence of the concept
- 2 - adequate evidence of the concept
- 3 - substantial evidence of the concept

{{< expand "Scoring Breakdown" >}}

The project is scored out of 7. 

*To calculate your score for the practices & concepts, look at the following bands:*

- 0 = 0
- 1 = 1
- 2 = 2-3
- 3 = 4-5
- 4 = 6-7
- 5 = 8-11
- 6 = 12-13
- 7 = 14-15

## [4] Success Claims

ðŸ’¯ **Successful computer scientists should be able to make the following claims:**
- Planning 
    - I can plan a reserach project 
    - I can consistently track my progress with notes and comments
- Data Analysis  
    - I can combine and reorganize pieces of data to explore new relationships
    - I can generate summary statistics (mean, median, mode, count) for describing the data
- Data Visualization 
    - I can display dataframes, charts, and plots that are thoughtfully sorted and easy to read
    - I can generate a variety of dataframes, charts, and plots to communicate and highlight different aspects of my data
- Data Communication Communication: Poster & Presentation 
    - I can explain the purpose and focus of the research 
    - I can explain my methodology, including action steps and reasoning for restructuring the data
    - I can reflect on the meaning of the data and provide context of the results
    - I can discuss the limitations and potential biases of my data and analysis 
    - I can consider potential future areas of investigation if I were to continue this project

**Keep the success claims in mind when coding your project.**
