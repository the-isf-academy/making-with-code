# Terminal Adventure
This lab will explore one of the most important tools we'll use all year: the Terminal. The Terminal is what we'll use to navigate our filesystem, run code files, install software, and
do all kinds of other tasks.


{{< aside "Windows Users" >}}
Windows users should use Powershell wherever it says Terminal.

You may see more information output than your Mac peers, but all commands should work the same.

## [0] Setup

First, we want to make some folders to store our work. Do this we'll be using these three commands:

| Command              | What it does                                 |
| --------------       | -------------------------------------------- |
| `ls`                 | List what's in the current directory (folder).        |
| `mkdir`              | Make a new directory (folder)                   |
| `cd folder`       | Go to `folder`                            |
| `cd ..`       | Go up one to the previous folder                            |

{{< code-action >}} **Open Terminal and use `ls` to list out where you are in your folder system.** 

```shell
ls
```

üëÄ **You should see something like this.**

```shell
Applications         Downloads            Pictures
Creative Cloud Files Library              Public
Desktop              Movies
Documents            Music
```

{{< code-action >}} **Then, use `cd` to change directories to your `Desktop`.** A directory is just a fancy word for a folder.

```shell
cd Desktop
```

---

{{< code-action >}} **Use the `mkdir` command to make a directory called `making_with_code`** `mkdir` stands for, make directory.

```shell
mkdir making_with_code
```

{{< code-action >}} **Use `ls` to check the folder was created.** 

```shell
ls
```

{{< code-action  >}} **Use `cd` to enter your new `making_with_code` directory.**

```shell
cd making_with_code
```
<!-- 
---

{{< code-action "Make a CS9 folder" >}}

```shell
mkdir CS9
```
{{< code-action "Go into the CS9 folder" >}}

```shell
cd CS9
``` -->

---


{{< code-action  >}} **Make a `unit00_drawing` directory.** This will store your files for our first unit. 

```shell
mkdir unit00_drawing
```
{{< code-action  >}} **Go into the `unit00_drawing` folder**
```shell
cd unit00_drawing
```

---

{{< code-action "Run the following command in your terminal to clone today's lab." >}} This will make a copy of the code on your own computer. *This uses something called `git` and `Github`, you will learn more about this later this unit.*

```shell
git clone https://github.com/the-isf-academy/lab_terminal_adventure.git
```

{{< code-action "Go into the lab_terminal_adventure folder" >}}
```shell
cd lab_terminal_adventure
```

---

{{< code-action "Next, we enter the Poetry shell." >}} This will ensure all of the correct packages and versions of those packages are being used. 
> You will use `poetry shell`, everytime you want to work on a lab or project. 
```shell
poetry shell
```
> You should see the following output:
> ```shell
> Creating virtualenv lab-00-terminal-adventure-shGU1wL6-py3.10 in /Users/eqbrown/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs
> Spawning shell within /Users/eqbrown/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs/lab-00-terminal-adventure-shGU1wL6-py3.10
>bash-5.1$ . /Users/eqbrown/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs/lab-00-terminal-adventure-shGU1wL6-py3.10/bin/activate
>(lab-00-terminal-adventure-shGU1wL6-py3.10) bash-5.1$

{{< aside "Exiting the poetry shell" >}}
When you want to exit the shell, you can type `exit` or `^D`
{{< /aside >}}

üìÅ **Your folders are now all properly setup for `cs`!**

---

## [1] Starting your Adventure

{{< code-action >}} **Let's have a look at what's in the `lab_terminal_adventure` repository with `ls`.** A *repository* is just a fancy word for a folder that is stored in the cloud using a version control software. 
```shell
ls
```
> You should see the following output:
> ```shell
> adventure	    returnToShip.py  poetry.lock	pyproject.toml
> ```
> `returnToShip.py` is a runnable Python file (you can tell by the `.py` at the end).

{{< code-action "Run it to see what happens:" >}}

```shell
python returnToShip.py

```
> You should see the following output:
> ```shell
>Your adventure has only just begun. You are not yet ready to return
>to the ship. More secrets await you in the ocean's depths.
>```

{{< aside "Your challenge is to see if you can get the treasure, using just the Terminal" >}}

Use Terminal to explore the contents of the `adventure` directory.

{{< /aside >}}



{{< code-action "Begin by going into into the" >}}  `adventure` **directory:**

```shell
cd adventure
ls
```
> You should see the following output:
> ```shell
>seafloor	sinking.txt
>```

`sinking.txt` is a text file, so we can read it.

{{< code-action "Try using the " >}} `cat` **command:**

```shell
cat sinking.txt
```


{{< code-action >}} **Continue exploring into the depths of the sea to find the treasure!** Return to the `lab_00_terminal_adventure` directory and run the `returnToShip.py` file to see if you were successful. If you were unable to escape the monster, try again!

### Terminal Commands
Below are some Terminal commands which might come in handy on your adventure.

## [3] Extension

{{< code-action >}} **Once you finish the Terminal Adventure, you may either explore `Vim` OR continue exploring drawing with the Python Turtle library.**


{{< columns >}}
### Vim

Vim is text-editor that you can use to write code directly inside your Terminal. Ms. Brown or Ms. Genzlinger may have used `vim` to activate `Poetry` on your computer. 

**üíª To learn `vim`, in your Terminal type:**
> *You can create a new `tab` in your terminal with `‚åò+t`*
```shell
vimtutor
```

Vimtutor is a built in tutorial for learning `vim`.

<--->

### Python Turtle


üíª **Go to [bit.ly/day1_cs9](https://trinket.io/python/196e77f175) and continue experiementing with Python code.** Can you figure out how to: 
- draw a polygon of any number of sides? *(triangle, hexagon, etc.)*
- draw the [olympic rings](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Olympic_rings_without_rims.svg/1200px-Olympic_rings_without_rims.svg.png)
- draw a [bullseye](https://compucademy.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/python-turtle-archery.png)
