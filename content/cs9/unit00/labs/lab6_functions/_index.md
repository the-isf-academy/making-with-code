# Functions Lab | Part I

In this lab, we will learn how to create and call functions. Functions are blocks of code that are reusable throughout a program. You've already encountered functions such as `print()`, which is a function built into Python.

## [1] What is a function?
Before we can talk about functions, we need to talk about code blocks. A **code block** is one or more lines of code. Here's one:

```python
forward(side_length)
left(120)
```

Sometimes we decide how many times a code block should run, or whether it should run at all.
Consider this code, which will draw a triangle:

```python
for each_item in range(3):
    forward(side_length)
    left(120)
```

We have the same code block, but now it's indented under the loop `for each_item in range(3):`. This means
the code block should run once for each item in the range.



Often times we want to reuse a code block in different sections of a program. `Functions` allow for code reuse without needing to copy and paste code blocks. **Here is a code block with a function definition and a function call:**

```python {linenos=table}
def draw_triangle(side_length):
    #This function draws a triangle
    for i in range(3):
        forward(side_length)
        left(120)

draw_triangle(200)
```

> A few things to note:
>
> - `line 1`
>   - `def` defines a new function called `draw_triangle()`
>   - it takes one parameter, or argument, called `side_length`
> - `line 4`
>   - `side_length` is used as a variable
>   - you can use a function's parameters inside the function as variables
> - `line 7`
>   - `draw_triangle(200)` calls the function with a `side_length` of `200`
>   - Once you have written a function, you must call it to use it.

{{< expand "A few more tips on functions..." >}}
- Whenever a code block is indented, there's always a line introducing it. This line always ends with a colon.
- The way you indent matters. **Always use the tab key to indent.**
- When you're done with a code block, just stop indenting.

- After the function's name is the list of arguments, surrounded by parentheses `(side_length)`. Arguments, or parameters, are the things you need to tell the program before you can use the function. Think of arguments as questions the program might ask about what to do. For `draw_triangle`, the program wants to know "How long should the length of the sides be?" and you have to tell it the `side_length`. Some functions won't have any arguments, so their parameters list will look like `()`. It depends how you design your functions.
- The first line of the function's code block should be a comment explaining what the function does.

{{< aside >}}
**Functions make your code simpler.** Instead of writing all the code for a triangle over and over, you can get it right once and put it in a function.

**Once you have written a function, you must call it.** Calling a function tells Python to run that block of code. Remember, order matters. **Code is read from top to bottom.** You cannot call a function before it has been written.

### Editing a Function

{{< code-action "Let's start by running" >}} `triangle.py`
```shell
python triangle.py
```

{{< figure src="images/courses/cs9/unit00/06_functions_0.png" width="300px">}}


{{< code-action "Now, let's open the file:" >}}
```shell
code triangle.py
```
Notice how it calls the `draw_triangle()` function with a `side_length` of `200`.

{{< code-action "Experiment by editing the parameter and then re-running the program." >}} For example, change `200` to `500`.

---

### Writing  a Function

Now that you've had some practice editing a function, let's write a new one.

{{< code-action "Open the file:" >}} `hexagon.py`
```shell
code hexagon.py
```

{{< code-action "Write a function that draws a hexagon with any side_length." >}} You will need to:

0. Write the function `draw_hexagon()`.
    - It should have one parameter called `side_length`
0. Call the function `draw_hexagon()` below the function definition.
    - It should be able to be called with any number for the `side_length`.

*Your finished drawing should look something like this:*
{{< figure src="images/courses/cs9/unit00/06_functions_1.png" width="300px">}}

{{< expand "Extension: Polygon" >}}

ü§î **Do you notice a pattern between the `draw_traingle()` and the `draw_hexagon()` function?** 

üíª **How could you write 1 function called `draw_polygon()` that could draw a polygon of any number of sides?** *You will need another parameter in addition to `side_length`*

{{< /expand >}}

## [2] Combining functions

**When you want to draw something fancy, you need to break it down into smaller steps.** Then you can write functions to do the smaller steps, and write more functions to combine small steps into bigger steps. This concept is called **decomposition**.

{{< figure src="https://www.learning.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Decomposition-2-383x360.png" width="30%">}}


‚úîÔ∏è **If we want to draw an ice cream cone with scoops of ice cream, we can break it down into steps:**

- Draw an ice cream cone: `cone(side_length)`
- Draw a scoop of ice cream: `scoop(num_scoops)`

{{< figure src="https://www.thespruceeats.com/thmb/btLT5e97Xl3vBzNo37xPlUgfQcI=/3135x3900/filters:fill(auto,1)/GettyImages-90053856-588b7aff5f9b5874ee534b04.jpg" width="30%">}}

### Draw Ice Cream


{{< code-action "Open the file: " >}} `code icecream.py`. As you can see, the function definitions are already provided. You just need to call the functions:
- `scoop(num_scoops)`
- `cone(size_length)`


{{< code-action "Complete the ice cream drawing by calling the functions to draw an ice cream cone. " >}} You need to use other turtle functions and experiment with the parameters to align the `scoop()` and the `cone()` perfectly. A few useful turtle functions include, but not limited to:
- `forward()`
- `backward()`
- `right()`
- `left()`
- `penup()`
- `pendown()`
- `goto()`

{{< figure src="images/courses/cs9/unit00/06_functions_icecream0.png" width="200px">}}

{{< code-action >}} **Now, add in color by adding a second parameter to `scoop()` and `cone()`.** 
> *Note: a variable cannot be the same name as a function. We suggest using the parameters `scoop_color` and `cone_color`.*

{{< figure src="images/courses/cs9/unit00/06_functions_icecream1.png" width="200px">}}


{{<aside "FYI: How to Fill a Shape with Color and More!" >}}
üíª To fill your turtle drawing with color follow the below format. You must call `begin_fill()` before the shape has been drawn and `end_fill()` after.

```python
circle_color = "blue"
fillcolor(circle_color)     #Tells the turtle to set the fill color

begin_fill()                #Tells the turtle to start the color fill
circle(200)
end_fill()                  #Tells the turtle to stop the color fill
```
<br>

üìñ *For a wide range of color options look at this [chart](http://cng.seas.rochester.edu/CNG/docs/x11color.html).*

## [4] Extension: Ice Cream Parlor

### Number of Scoops

Right now, you can only have 1 scoop of ice cream üò¢. But, it's way more fun to have multiple scoops of ice cream!

üíª **Add another parameter to `scoop()`called `num_scoops`.** This should draw any number of scoops on top of each other. 

{{< figure src="images/courses/cs9/unit00/06_functions_icecream.png" width="25%">}}

--- 

### Sprinkles

What's even more fun than multiple scoops, sprinkles! 

üíª **Write  a new function, `sprinkles()` that takes, `flavor` as a parameter.** It should randomly place sprinkles on the scoops of ice cream. 

{{< figure src="images/courses/cs9/unit00/06_functions_icecream3.png" width="25%">}}

*For random integers:*

```python
from random import randint

randint(0,100)
```

--- 

### User Input

Now that we have colors and number of scoops, let's add in user input!

{{< code-action "Expand the functionality of this program to simulate an ice cream parlor."  >}} The user should be able to choose the flavor of the ice-cream and the number of scoops.

{{<aside "Hints" >}}

Consider the following:
- How will you include user input?
- How will you translate the flavor "chocolate" to the color "brown?

{{</aside>}}

Here is an example interaction:

```shell
python ice_cream.py

--- Welcome to the ISF ice cream parlor ---

What flavor would you like?
   > Select a flavor (chocolate, strawberry, vanilla): chocolate
How many scoops would you like?
   > Select number of scoops (max 3): 3
Do you want prinkles?
   > Enter yes or no: no

--- Enjoy your ice cream! Please come again! ---
