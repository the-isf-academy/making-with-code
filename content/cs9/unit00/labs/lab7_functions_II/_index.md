## [0] Set up

{{< code-action "Start by going into the unit folder." >}}
```shell
cd ~/desktop/making_with_code/unit00_drawing/
```

{{< code-action "Then clone the lab" >}}
```shell
git clone https://github.com/the-isf-academy/lab_functions2.git
```

{{< code-action "Now that you have the lab, go into its folder." >}}
```shell
cd lab_functions2
```

{{< code-action "Enter the Poetry Shell to start the lab." >}} As a reminder, we will run this command at the start of each lab, but only when we are inside a lab folder.
```shell
poetry shell
```

When you want to exit the shell, you can type `exit` or `^D`

```
{{< look-action "Take a look at the code inside" >}}

```python

    fillcolor(circle_color)
    begin_fill()
    circle(circle_size)
    end_fill()

```


### [Helpful Turtle Functions]

Here are some helpful Turtle functions that may make this problem easier. You are not required to use all of these functions.

| Function |       Input      |   Example Use  | Explanation                                                                                                                      |

| begin_fill  |       None     |  `begin_fill()`  | Marks the start of the color fill       |
| end_fill  |       None     |   `end_fill()`   | Marks the end of the color fill           |
| fillcolor  |       colorname     |   `fillcolor('purple')`  | Sets the color of the fill          |

| bgcolor  |       colorname     |   `bgcolor()`   | Changes the background of the turtle screen           |
| colormode  |       colorname     |   `colormode(255)`  | Changes the turtle color to accept rgb colors.  e.g. color(255,15,23)          |

## [1] Circle Patterns

This mini lab is designed to be a pick and choose adventure. The patterns below are in order of difficulty. It is up to you to **choose patterns that are at an appropriate level of difficulty for you**.

**Each of the patterns rely on the `filled_circle()` function provided in the starter code.**


{{< aside "Commenting Code" >}}

It can be incredibly useful to use comment code! Comments are useful for
- leaving yourself notes
- leaving others notes 
- isolating testing 

```python
# this is a comment
# print('hello')
```

In visual studio code, **you can select one or multiple lines of code and press `⌘+?` to comment or uncomment code**.

### Alternating Pattern


{{< figure src="images/courses/cs9/unit00/lab_08_functions_00.png" width="50%">}}

{{< code-action >}} **Code a function `alternating_pattern(num_circles)`**
> *Example function call: `alternating_pattern(5)`*
   - It takes `num_circles` as a parameter - this will change the amount of circles in the pattern
   - Hard code the 2 colors to alternate between
   - *Hint: look at the conditionals lab*

For an additional challenge:
- add `num_circle_size` as a parameter - this will change the size of the circles in the pattern
   - *Example function call: `alternating_pattern(5,200)`*

---

### Bullseye

{{< figure src="images/courses/cs9/unit00/lab_08_functions_01.png" width="50%">}}


{{< code-action >}} **Code a function `bullseye_pattern(num_circles, starting_circle_size)`**
> *Example function call: `bullseye_pattern(5, 200)`*

   - It takes `num_circles` and `starting_circle_size` as parameters - the number of circles and the size of the bullseye should adjust accordingly
   - Hard code the 2 colors to alternate between

For an additional challenge:
- add `color1` and `color2` as parameters - this will change the colors of the pattern.
   - *Example function call: `bullseye_pattern(5, 200, 'coral', 'light blue')`*

---

### Size Pattern
{{< figure src="images/courses/cs9/unit00/lab_08_functions_02.png" width="50%">}}

{{< code-action >}} **Code a function `size_pattern(num_columns, num_rows, color)`**
> *Example function call: `size_pattern(6,5,'coral')`*

- It takes `num_columns`, `num_rows`, and `color` as parameters

---

### Half-tone Pattern

{{< figure src="images/courses/cs9/unit00/lab_08_functions_03.png" width="50%">}}

{{< code-action >}} **Code a function `halftone_pattern(num_columns, num_rows, color1, color2)`**
> *Example function call: `halftone_pattern(6,5,'dark blue','light blue')`*

- It takes `num_columns`, `num_rows`, `color1`, and `color2` as parameters

---

### Random Pattern

{{< figure src="images/courses/cs9/unit00/lab_08_functions_04.png" width="50%">}}

{{< code-action >}} **First, code a function `thick_circle(circle_size, circle_color, thickness)`**
- It should draw a circle of any color, size, and any pen thickness

{{< code-action >}} **Second, code a function `random_pattern(num_circles, background_color)`**
> *Example function call: `random_pattern(20,'black')`*

- It should create a random pattern of thick circles and filled circles
- The circles should all be of random colors and sizes.


**This will require you to:**
-  use the `randint()` function from the random library
   - add `from random import randint` to the top of your file
- change the color mode to accept rgb colors
   - add `colormode(255)` to the start of the function
