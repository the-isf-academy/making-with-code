# Initial setup

**Welcome to CS! These instructions will help you get your computer set up for the class.**
If you get stuck or are unsure what to do, send a screenshot of your error to Ms. Brown or Ms. Genzlinger.


---
## Visual Studio Code
*This is the editor that you will use to write your code.*

(0) **Download and Install.** [Open this link](https://code.visualstudio.com/), click "Download for macOS," or click on "other plaforms" to choose your operating system. Follow the installation instructions.

(1) **Drag to Applications Folder.** Open up the `Finder` application on your Mac. On the left hand side, click on `Downloads`.  Drag `Visual Studio Code` to the folder named `Applications`.

(2) **Install Shell Commands.** Open up your freshly installed `Visual Studio Code` application. From the top menu, select `View > Command Pallete`. 

{{< figure src="images/courses/cs9/unit00/-000_initialsetup7.png" width="75%" alt-text="mwc setup" >}}

In the prompt, type `Shell Commands` and click on the first option to install the `code` command in your PATH.

## Opening the Terminal

For most of the remaining setup, you will be using your `Terminal`. This is an application that lets you type commands directly to your computer. You can access it through any of these ways:

- Using your `üîç spotlight search` (press `‚åò`+`space` then type "terminal")
{{< figure src="images/courses/cs9/unit00/-000_initialsetup9.png" width="75%" alt-text="mwc setup" >}}

- Or, you can find it using your computer's `launchpad`
{{< figure src="images/courses/cs9/unit00/-000_initialsetup11.png" height="25%" alt-text="mwc setup" >}}


One you have it open, it should look something like this:
{{< figure src="images/courses/cs9/unit00/-000_initialsetup10.png" width="50%" alt-text="mwc setup" >}}

## Installing Xcode

{{< code-action "Copy and paste the command below into your Terminal to install Xcode." >}} Then press `Enter/Return`. Make sure you have a strong internet connection, this may take up to 2 hours to complete. Don't worry, you can still use your computer and have it running in the background. 

```shell
xcode-select --install
```


{{< code-action "Enter your password when prompted." >}} You won't see any letters appearing as you enter the password. This is a security feature.

{{< aside >}}
If you already have this installed, you will see the following message instead:
```shell
xcode-select: error: command line tools are already installed, use "Software Update" to install updates
```
{{</ aside >}}

## Installing Python
*Python is the language we will be coding in*

(0) **Start by installing the latest version of Python.** [Open this link](https://www.python.org/downloads/), click "Download Python," and follow the installation instructions.


(1) **Once the installation finishes, you will see a Finder window showing what was installed**.
(If you closed the window, open Finder, click on "Applications," and then "Python 3.12" (or whatever version of Python you just installed).


(2) **Check Python installed successfully by typing `python --version` into the Terminal.** You should see a version number above `3.12`.

(3) **Double-click on "Install Certificates.command".** This will will open a Terminal window and run a bunch of commands. Once you see `[Process completed]`, you may close the window.

(4) **Double-click on "Update Shell Profile.command".** Each of these will open a Terminal window and run a bunch of commands. Once you see `[Process completed]`, you may close the window.

[Here is a video that walks you through the steps.](https://youtu.be/OiCiOgeyaWA)


{{< aside >}}
**If you see a red "Permission denied" error message when running "Install Certificates.command"**:
- open a Terminal window and run **`sudo "/Applications/Python 3.12/Install Certificates.command"`**
- You will be asked for an administrator password; you won't see any letters appearing as you enter the password. This is a security feature.
{{</ aside >}}

## Installing Homebrew
*Homebrew helps you install different libraries and packages*

{{< code-action "Run the below command to install homebrew." >}} This will install homebrew onto your computer. This may take up to an hour to complete. Don't worry, you can still use your computer and have it running in the background. If you already have homebrew, then this step will be quick.

```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

üíª **As the installation runs, follow all the instructions, such as:**

**1. Type your password** - you won't see any letters appearing as you enter the password. This is a security feature.

{{< figure src="images/courses/cs9/unit00/-000_initialsetup13.png" width="50%" alt-text="mwc setup" >}}


**2. Press `return` to continue** 

{{< figure src="images/courses/cs9/unit00/-000_initialsetup14.png" width="50%" alt-text="mwc setup" >}}

**It may ask you to press `Enter` a few more times throughout the process.**

You will know it is finished when you see your username and a `$` once again. For example:*
```shell
bgenzlinger~/Documents$
```

## Installing Poetry
*Poetry makes sure your coding environment is set up to work for all your coding projects*

{{< code-action "Run the below command to install Pipx with Brew." >}} You MUST install `pipx` after installing `homebrew`. 
```shell
brew install pipx
```

{{< code-action "Run the below command to install Poetry." >}} 
```shell
pipx install poetry
```

---


## Testing your Setup



üíª **Run each of the following checks one at a time to check your setup.** If you do not see an `version number`, there was an error with the install.

‚úîÔ∏è *Checks `Visual Studio Code`*

```shell
code --version
```

‚úîÔ∏è *Checks `Xcode`*

```shell
xcode-select --version
```

‚úîÔ∏è *Checks `Python`*

python3 --version
```

‚úîÔ∏è *Checks `Homebrew`*
