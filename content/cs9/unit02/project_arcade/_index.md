## [0] Planning Booklet 

This is a big project with a lot of room for customization. You will need to:
- outline the type of game you'd like to make
- sketch the map 
- sketch the sprites 
- plan an additional feature(s)

It is important for you to plan the game prior to coding. This will help you stay on track and enable the teachers to provide better help. 

{{< write-action "Plan your game prior to coding in your Team Booklet" >}} 

{{< aside "A few feature ideas" >}}

- player health
- attacking enemies 
- multiple players 
- multiple levels 
- timed level(s)
