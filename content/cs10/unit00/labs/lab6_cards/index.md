# Cards

In this lab we will create a Client in the form of a Command Line Interface(CLI) for the Deck of Cards API. We will use the `Requests` library to send and recieve HTTP requests. To learn more about the `Requests` library, checkout its [documentation](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).


---


## [0] Deck of Cards API

The API that we will use for today is called the Deck of Cards API. It is free, simple, and easy-to-use. 

üåê **Here is a link to the [Deck of Cards API Documentation](https://www.deckofcardsapi.com/).** 

---

## [1] Set Up


{{< code-action "Go to the unit folder, clone the cards lab, and cd into the repo." >}}
```shell
cd ~/desktop/making_with_code/cs10/unit00_networking/
git clone https://github.com/the-isf-academy/lab_cards_YOURGITHUBUSERNAME
cd lab_cards_YOURGITHUBUSERNAME
```

{{< code-action "Install the requirements." >}}
```shell
poetry install
```

{{< code-action "Enter the poetry shell." >}}
```shell
poetry shell
```

üìÑ **The repository has the following files:** 
- `client.py`
- `requests_interface.py`
- `view.py`

---

## [2] Improve the View()

Even though `client.py` and `requests_interface.py` are fully filled in and working, the game isn't very aesthetically pleasing. And you can't even see what cards you have! Let's improve `views.py` so that the user experience is better.

{{< code-action "Try the client" >}}
```shell
python client.py
```

```shell
Menu:
> Start New Deck                                                         
  Deal a Card
  View Cards
  Reset Deck                                                         
  Quit        
```

It's pretty boring. There's no welcome message, and it doesn't tell you what's happening. You can't even see your cards!


{{< code-action "Open up the code" >}}
```shell
code .
```


---

### Welcome Message

The first thing we need is a welcome message! You might design in the style of our previous labs like this:

```shell
-----------------------------------
---- Cards ----
-----------------------------------       
```
or you can design your own.

üíª **Add a welcome method to the `View` class, and call it in `client.py`**

---

### Quit Message

Add a message for when the game ends

```shell
-----------------------------------
---- Goodbye ----
-----------------------------------
       
```

üíª **Add a quit method to the `View` class, and call it in `client.py`**

---
### View Cards

The user needs to be able to see their cards.

```shell
Menu: View Cards
9 ‚ô•
4 ‚ô†
A ‚ô¶
J ‚ô£Ô∏è
```

üíª **Add a method for viewing your cards to the `View` class, and call it in `client.py`**

---

### Client Messaging

There is currently no messaging to the user if any of the menu options are successful or unsuccessful. 

```shell
Menu: Start New Deck

Menu: Deal a Card

Menu: Reset Deck
```

üíª **Add 3 methods `View` class to provide descriptive messaging to the user.** An example improved interface: 

```shell
Menu: Start New Deck
-- Created a new deck: 3hif58bmuz9t

Menu: Deal a Card
--  Delt J‚ô£Ô∏è to player

Menu: Reset Deck
-- Reset deck 3hif58bmuz9t (returned cards to deck and shuffled)
```

---

## [3] Error Handling

### No Deck

You might notice right now that if you attempt to deal, view, or reset before you start a deck, you get an error:

```shell
TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "NoneType") to str
```

This is because you haven't made a deck yet!

üëÄ **Look at the constructor of the `RequestsInterface` class below:**

```python {linenos=inline, hl_lines=9,linenostart=9}
def __init__(self):
    self.deckofcards_url = 'https://www.deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/' # the base url for the cards api

    self.view = View()

    # deck_id is initalized in get_new_deck()
        # you may want to hard code it during testing 
        # you can hard code it by finding a valid deck_id by printing the deck_json under line 27
    self.deck_id = None  
```

Notice how `self.deck_id` starts as `None`, because it hasn't been created yet. You need to add error handling to the client that checks whether the `deck_id` is `None`, and if it is, let the user know that they should make a deck first.

üíª **Add an error message method in `views.py` telling the user to make a deck first.**
<br>

üíª **Add error handling to `client.py` to trigger this message.**

## [4] Deliverables

{{< deliverables "Once you've successfully improved the View()." >}}  

{{< code-action "Push your code to Github." >}}
- git status
- git add -A
- git status
- git commit -m "describe your code and your process here"
  > be sure to customize this message, do not copy and paste this line
- git push

{{< /deliverables >}}

## [5] Extension 

### Improve the Client

The Deck of Cards API has so many features! Choose one of the options below to add to the existing client. For each feature, you will need to consider `client.py`, `view,py` and `requests_interface.py`. 

‚òëÔ∏è **Additional features:**
- drawing multiple cards at a time
  - allow user to choose how many cards to deal 
- multiplayer piles 
  - allow user to enter their player name 
  - create a pile with that name
  - view each player's pile 
- discard pile 
  - add a discard pile 
  - view the discard pile

*You may also add in a feature we did not list below! For example, implementing a simple card game.*

---

### Fix the 500 Error

Right now, if you try to view your cards before you have any, you get a 500 error

```shell
[Error: HTTP 500]
```
üíª **Add in error handling so that the 500 error doesn't happen.**

---


### No Cards Delt Error

You might notice right now that if you attempt to `View Cards` and you have not selected `Deal a Card` prior, it will result in an error. This is because that pile does not exist yet. 
  

```shell
KeyError: 'player'
```


üíª **Fix this error whichever way makes most sense to you.** You could change the menu, you could change the `RequestInterface()` or the `View()`.
