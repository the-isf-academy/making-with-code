# The Terminal: Reloaded
This lab will re-explore one of our most important and most used tools: the Terminal.
The Terminal is what we use to navigate our filesystem, run code files, install software, and
do all kinds of other tasks.

The last time you ventured into the Terminal, you came away with treasure! It's time to dive back into the sea and see what's hiding.

## [0] Setup

{{< aside "Windows Users" >}}
Windows users should use Powershell wherever it says Terminal.

You may see more information output than your Mac peers, but all commands should work the same.
{{< /aside >}}

{{< code-action "First clone the Terminal Adventure Sequel." >}} 
```shell
git clone https://github.com/the-isf-academy/lab_terminal_adventure_sequel
cd lab_terminal_adventure_sequel
```


{{< code-action "Enter the Poetry Shell." >}} Remember, we run this command at the start of each lab, but only when we are inside a lab folder.
```shell
poetry shell
```
{{< aside "Exiting the poetry shell" >}}
When you want to exit the shell, you can type `exit` or `^D`
{{< /aside >}}


## [1] Adventure

{{< code-action "Now take a look at what's in the repository:" >}} `ls`
```shell
kitchen	    captain.py     helpers.py    poetry.lock	pyproject.toml
```

> `captain.py` is a runnable Python file (you can tell by the `.py` at the end). *`helpers.py` provides some useful functions that are utilized in this adventure, and `poetry.lock`	and `pyproject.toml` can be ignored.*

{{< code-action  >}} **Run `captian.py` to see what happens! You will end this lab by successfully making a sandwich!** Explore the corners of the kitchen to find the necessary supplies.
