# Riddle Database

In this lab we are going to delve into databases and a new software, `banjo`.

## [0] Experience the ISF Riddle Server

The last time we saw riddles, they existed only within each of your computers. You had to manually add new ones and there was no way to keep track of how many people guessed them.

We are now going to look at Riddles that are hosted on the internet!

{{< code-action >}} **Visit [http://sycs.student.isf.edu.hk/riddle/all](http://sycs.student.isf.edu.hk/riddle/all) to view riddle server.**
> Not very easy to read, right? You can install the [JSON Formatter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?hl=en) Chrome extension to view better formatted JSON.*

{{< code-action >}} **Now try making `GET` request to `http://sycs.student.isf.edu.hk/riddle/all` receive the same information using : [httpie.io/app](https://httpie.io/app)**


{{< figure src="images/courses/cs10/unit00/02_banjo_05.png" alt-text="databases" >}}



{{< code-action >}} **Do you know the answer? Try sending a `POST` request to make a guess.** This request to a different url `endpoint`: `/guess`

0. Add a new request
0. Change `GET` to `POST`
0. Paste in the URL: `http://sycs.student.isf.edu.hk/riddle/guess`
0. Select `Body`
0. At the bottom, change `None` to `Form`
0. Add the *payloads:* `id` and `guess`

{{< figure src="images/courses/cs10/unit00/02_banjo_03.png" alt-text="databases" >}}

> **It is common for `POST` requests to send a *payload* with the request.** In this case, the payloads are:
> - `id` specifying which riddle we are guessing
> - `guess` specifying the guess
> We are also sending this request to a different url `endpoint`: `/guess`

### Explore the Endpoints

**🔗 Server APIs often rely on different URL *endpoints* to the *base url* to determine what the API should do.**
- The base url to this server is: `http://sycs.student.isf.edu.hk/riddle`

Here is a cheatsheet of the Riddle endpoints, what parameters they take in their payload, and what they do:

| Method | URL                                | Required Payload     | Action                                                                                   |
| ------ | ---------------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `/all`   |                      | Returns a list of all the riddles, without answers.                                      |
| `GET`  | `/one`   | `id`                 | Returns the riddle if it exists |
| `POST` | `/new`   | `question`, `answer` | Creates a new riddle (with an automatically-assigned id). Returns the riddle.            |
| `POST` | `/guess` | `id`, `guess`        | Checks whether the guess is correct. In the response, `correct` is `True` or `False`.    |
| `GET`  | `/difficulty`   | `id`                 | Returns the riddle if it exists with its difficulty score. (Otherwise, it returns an error with status code 404.)  |



{{< checkpoint >}}

{{< code-action "Explore each endpoint in the `httpie tool`, and be sure to successfully:" >}}
- view all riddles without the answers
- view a single riddle
- add a new riddle
- guess a riddle
- try to break the riddle server, what happens when you provide incorrect parameters?

📖 **When using the the httpie tool,**
- for a `GET` request, put the *payload* in the `Params`
- for a `POST` request, put the *payload* in the `Body` > `Form`

## [1] Set Up

<!-- For this lab, we need to download software to view the database in a nicely formatted chart.

{{< code-action "Download dbsqlite onto your computer:" >}} [https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/)

{{< figure src="https://sqlitebrowser.org/images/sqlitebrowser.svg" alt-text="database icon" >}} -->

{{< code-action "Let's clone the repository" >}} in your `unit03_networking` folder.  Be sure to change `yourgithubusername` to your actual Github username.

```shell
cd ~/desktop/making_with_code/unit03_networking
git clone https://github.com/the-isf-academy/lab_banjo_yourgithubusername
cd lab_banjo_yourgithubusername
```

{{< code-action "Get the other necessary packages:" >}}
```shell
poetry install
```

{{< code-action "Enter the Poetry shell" >}} 
```shell
poetry shell
```
{{< aside "Exiting the poetry shell" >}}
When you want to exit the shell, you can type `exit` or `^D`
{{< /aside >}}

📄 **This repository has two main files inside a the `/app` directory:**
- `/app`
    - `models.py`: This defines the model 
    - `views.py`: This defines the routes

## [2] Databases

### Riddle Model

Now that you've experienced the riddle server, let's delve into how it's made.

The `Riddle` objects looks almost identical to how it looked in the Riddler lab. **The main difference, is we must define the datatype of each property.** This tells the database, what type of information each property will store.

```python
class Riddle(Model):
    question = StringField()
    answer = StringField()
    guesses = IntegerField()
    correct = IntegerField()

    MIN_FUZZ_RATIO = 80
```
<!--

### Viewing the Database

You have just downloaded a simple server that hosts `Riddles` onto your laptop. Let's start by looking at the its database.

{{< code-action "Open the database in the DB Browser:" >}}
```shell
open database.sqlite
```

{{< code-action "Select" >}} `Browse Data`

{{< figure src="images/courses/cs10/unit00/02_banjo_00.png" alt-text="databases" >}}


{{< look-action "Here you will see all of the riddles that are in your locally hosted server." >}} This database file gets updated each time you guess or add a `Riddle`.

{{< figure src="images/courses/cs10/unit00/02_banjo_01.png" alt-text="databases" >}} -->

### Banjo Shell

In this unit, we will be using `Banjo` and wrapper over [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). Django is a popular web framework that is used to quickly create web apps. We will be using Django in the spring, so for now we will `Banjo` to introduce the software.

{{< code-action "Let's enter the Banjo shell to interact with the riddles." >}}
```shell
banjo --shell
```
```shell

{{< code-action "Let's start by just viewing all the riddles in the shell:" >}}
```shell
Riddle.objects.all()
```
```shell
<QuerySet [<Riddle 1: I'm tall when I'm young, and I'm short when I'm old. What am I? (11/33)>, <Riddle 2: How many months of the year have 28 days? (5/10)>, <Riddle 3: I can fly but have no wings. I can cry but I have no eyes. Wherever I go, darkness follows me. What am I? (0/2)>, <Riddle 4: What has to be broken before you can use it? (3/7)>, <Riddle 5: The more you take, the more you leave behind. What are they? (3/10)>, <Riddle 6: What is so delicate that saying its name breaks it? (5/6)>, <Riddle 7: I am always in front and never behind. What am I? (2/2)>]>
```

{{< code-action "Now, let's add a new riddle:" >}}
```shell
new_riddle = Riddle(question='If you feed it, it lives; If you water it, it dies.', answer='Fire')
new_riddle.save()
```
> *Note how you must `save()` the riddle to ensure it gets saved in the database.*

{{< checkpoint >}}
Before moving on, make sure the Riddle was properly saved:
- view all the `Riddle` objects
- refresh the database in the DB Browser
{{< /checkpoint >}}

{{< code-action "Now, let's try to guess the riddle we just added:" >}}
```shell
>>> new_riddle.check_guess('fire')
True
```

{{< checkpoint >}}
Before moving on, make sure the Riddle properties, `guesses`, and `correct`, were properly updated:
- view all the `Riddle` objects
- refresh the database in the DB Browser
{{< /checkpoint >}}

### Database Querying

Now that you've experienced adding and updating the database, we're going to explore how to search, or query, the database.

📖 **Open the Banjo documentation:** [cs.fablearn.org/docs/banjo/index.html](https://cs.fablearn.org/docs/banjo/index.html)
> *If you find any typos, please let a teacher know - we can fix it!*

✏️ **Fill out the worksheet and refence the Banjo documentation**  to properly query the database using the Banjo shell.
> *You will use the Banjo/Djanog syntax throughout the whole year! Please be sure to experiment and ask any/all questions.*

## [4] Extension

Next lab we will explore how to write the Riddle server.

{{< code-action "Feel free to open up the code and start to understand how it works!" >}} Can you add a new *route* for just one riddle?
```shell
code .
```
