# Riddle Server

In this lab we are going to learn how the riddle server is made using Banjo.

üìñ **Open the Banjo documentation:** [the-isf-academy.github.io/banjo_docs/](https://the-isf-academy.github.io/banjo_docs/)

{{< expand "Debugging" >}}

**If you are getting an "Access Denied" error when visiting the `/api` route:**

0. Go to this url: `chrome://net-internals/#sockets`
0. Select "Flush socket pool"
0. Refresh the page

## [0] Set Up

{{< code-action "Download Mac app of HTTPIE:" >}} [ httpie.io/download](https://httpie.io/download). We need to download the app to make local HTTP requests for testing purposes. In this lab, you will run a locally hosted riddle server on your laptop using Banjo.

{{< figure src="https://httpie.io/Images/download-shape.svg" width="25%">}}



{{< code-action "Start by going into the unit folder and the lab." >}} Remember to replace `yourgithubusername` with your actual GitHub username.
```shell
cd ~/desktop/making_with_code/unit03_networking/
cd lab_banjo_yourgithubusername
```


{{< code-action "Upgrade versions" >}}
```shell
poetry update
```

{{< code-action "Enter the Poetry shell" >}}
```shell
poetry shell
```

## [1] Local Riddle Server

You are each able to run a locally hosted riddle server on your laptop using Banjo.

### Starting the Server

{{< code-action "Now, let's start your local server." >}} We use `--debug` to provide more information when in the development stage.
```shell
banjo --debug
```
```shell
No changes detected in apps 'app', 'banjo'

Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
```

---


### Accessing the Server

üíª **You can now visit this server in your web browser, just as you did with the riddler server hosted on the internet:**  [127.0.0.1:8000/riddle/all](http://127.0.0.1:8000/riddle/all)

üíª **Open the `HTTPie` desktop app to send the same `GET` request to `/all`.**

{{< figure src="images/courses/cs10/unit00/banjo_server_00.png" width=50%" >}}


{{< look-action " Look at the Terminal window running the server. Notice how it recorded your request." >}}
```shell
[16/Sep/2024 02:44:20] "GET /riddle/all HTTP/1.1" 200 1069
```

---

üíª **Send a `POST` request to the `/new` endpoint.** 
> Payload:
> - `question` (str)
> - `answer` (str)

{{< figure src="images/courses/cs10/unit00/banjo_server_01.png" width=50%" >}}

{{< expand "Getting a 400 Error?" >}}

Make sure you did all these steps: 

0. Change `all` to `new` in the url
0. Change `GET` to `POST`
0. Change `Params` to `Body`
0. At the bottom, change `None` to `Form`
0. Add the *payloads:* `question` and `answer`

{{< /expand  >}}

{{< look-action " Look at the Terminal window running the server. Notice how it recorded your request." >}}
```shell
[01/Sep/2024 20:56:22] "POST /riddle/new?id=1 HTTP/1.1" 200 127
```

---

Your version of the riddle server only has the 2 endpoints:
- `/riddle/all`
- `/riddle/new`

{{< checkpoint >}}

{{< code-action "Explore both endpoints via the HTTPie desktop app and be sure to successfully:" >}}
- view all riddles without the answers
- create a new riddle
{{< /checkpoint >}}

## [2] What is Banjo?

**This server is written using [Banjo](https://cs.fablearn.org/docs/banjo/index.html)**, a wrapper for [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). It allows users to quickly create models with a persistant database and API.

üìÅ **Banjo apps must have an `app` folder. Within the app folder must be two files: `models.py`, `views.py`.** The `database.sqlite` file is created when the server is first started. It is stored at the same level as `app`. Here is an example file structure:
```shell
lab_banjo
|
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄapp
|   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄmodels.py
|   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄviews.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄdatabase.sqlite
```
- `models.py` - This defines what the database will look like. Models are a lot like classes. Just as a class has properties, a model has fields. When defining a model's fields, you must specify the data type.
- `views.py` - The views are where you define the API functionality. Here is where you decide what the `endpoints` are and the type of `HTTP` request it will require.

üìÑ **In this lab, we are going to be primarily focused on the `views.py` file.**

---

## [3] Writing Routes

In this lab, you will build out the functionality of the Riddle server. Currently, your file only has `riddle/all` and `riddle/new`. 

**It is up to you to add the following endpoints:**
- `riddle/one`
- `riddle/guess`
- `riddle/difficulty`
- `riddle/random`

 <br>

{{< code-action "Start by opening up the primary folder:" >}} `/app`

```shell
code app
```

{{< aside >}}
Open a new terminal tab using `‚åò + T`.   
You can have your server running in one tab, and use the other tab to access your filesystem.
{{< /aside >}}
 <br>

{{< code-action >}} **Open the `views.py` file.** Here is where you will write the additional endpoints. 

üìñ **Open the Banjo Views Documentation: [the-isf-academy.github.io/banjo_docs/](https://the-isf-academy.github.io/banjo_docs/)** You will need to reference this and the exisiting routes in `views.py`.

<!-- üåê **You may also want to reference the Riddle server that is live on the web:** [sycs.student.isf.edu.hk/riddle](http://sycs.student.isf.edu.hk/riddle). This is a unique route `/api` that provides a basic frontend interaction with the API. -->

### riddle/one

{{< code-action >}} **Write the `riddle/one` endpoint.** 
- **HTTP method:** `get`
- **Payload/args:** `id`

ü§î *Which `method` in the `Riddle` `model` could be useful?*

{{< checkpoint >}}

üíª **Test the `riddle/one` endpoint in the `HTTPie desktop app`**

```shell
http://127.0.0.1:8000/riddle/one
```


‚úîÔ∏è **It should return `json` like:**

```json
{
  "riddle": {
    "id": 1,
    "question": "I‚Äôm light as a feather, yet the strongest person can‚Äôt hold me for five minutes. What am I?",

## [5] Extensions


### View Solution

Currently, there's no way to see the answer unless you correctly guess the riddle. 

{{< code-action >}} **Write an endpoint that has the ability to view the solution of a given Riddle.** 
> *Hint: a new method in the `Riddle` class may be useful*

It should return `JSON` that looks something like:
```json
{
    "riddle": [
        {
            "correct": 0,
            "guesses": 3,
            "id": 1,
            "question": "It goes up and down the stairs without moving.",
            "answer": "A carpet"
        }
    ]
}
```

---
### Change Question and Answer

{{< code-action >}} **Write an endpoint that has the ability to change the question a riddle.** 
> *Consider, what kind of HTTP request would be best for this?*

{{< code-action >}} **Write an endpoint that has the ability to change the answer a riddle.** 
> *Consider, what kind of HTTP request would be best for this?*

---

### Hidden Data 

Organizations often choose to keep data about their models that is not public. 

{{< code-action >}} **Add a new field to the `Riddle` model that tracks how many times that riddle has been accessed.** For example, each time the Riddle queried from `riddle/one`, `riddle/guess`, or `riddle/difficulty` the field will be increased by 1. 

{{< code-action >}} **Now, add a new field to the `Riddle` model that tracks how many times that riddle has been changed.**

ü§î **Be sure to hide these new fields from all your JSON responses.** You may want to write a secret endpoint, that provides all of the secret data. 


---

### Category field


{{< code-action >}} **Add a new field to the `Riddle` model called `category`.** 

{{< code-action >}} **Add a new endpoint for you to get all Riddle objects of a category**


---

### Foreign Key

Banjo has the ability to have relational databases. 

```python
from banjo.models import Model, StringField, IntegerField, ForeignKey, BooleanField, FloatField

class Artist(Model):
    name = StringField()


class Song(Model):
    name = StringField()
    artist = ForeignKey(Artist)
```

As Banjo is a wrapper over Django, it works just as the Django documentation states [HERE](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/db/examples/many_to_one/).

In the example code above, a **Artist** can be associated with many **Song** objects, but a **Song** object can only have one **Artist** object. 

üíª **Try to incorporate a many-to-one relationship in `models.py`.** A few ideas:
- Make the category field it's own Model. Each category can have many songs that belong to it.
- Make the question field its own Model to hold the history of changes
- Make the answer field its own Model to hold the history of changes



<!-- 
### Interface: Riddle Client 

We will talk more about clients later in this unit, but for now just aquaint yourself with the [Requests library](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 

{{< code-action >}} **Create a new python file:** `client.py`

{{< code-action >}}  **Try to access the public Riddle server, [http://sycs.student.isf.edu.hk/riddle/all](http://sycs.student.isf.edu.hk/riddle/all), using the `Requests` library in this file.**

{{< code-action >}} **A few more things to try:**
- format the response JSON in a user friendly, readable format 
- hit a GET route that requires a payload
- hit a POST route that requires a payload  -->
