## [0] Project Planning

Before you start working on your project, you will outline your implementation of the API. 

‚úèÔ∏è **Fill out the "Project Networking Backend Planning Document".** 

üëã **Meet with a teacher to discuss your idea before beginning to code**

## [1] Starter Code


{{< code-action "Download your repository with starter code for your project." >}} Be sure to change `yourgithubusername` to your actual Github username.

```shell
cd ~/desktop/making_with_code/cs10/unit00_networking/
git clone https://github.com/the-isf-academy/project_networking_frontend_yourgithubusername
cd project_networking_frontend_yourgithubusername
```

{{< code-action "Enter the poetry shell." >}}
```shell
poetry shell
```

{{< code-action "Install requirements" >}}
```shell
poetry install
```

üìÑ **It contains the following:**
- A `project_networking_frontend` repository containing the following:
  - `client.py` - This is where you will manage the user interactions. 
  - `requests_interface.py` - This is where you will manage the HTTP requests.
  - `view.py` - This is where you will manage the input and output for the user. 
  - `README.md` - This is documentation for the frontend of your project.
