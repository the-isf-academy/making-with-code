## [0] Project Overview

üé® **Design Brief:** In this project, you must create a social computing Web App. Users should be able to contribute, interact, view, and/or modify the Database. It is up to your team to decide what the App is its features.

## [1] Design Document

For this project, you will use a Miro board to design the frontend and backend of your Web App.

{{< look-action >}} **Start by taking a look at the template and duplicating it for your group:** [Miro Board Template](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMYd6V5Q=/?share_link_id=126518669077)

0. Click on `cs10 Web Apps Design Doc` in the top left corner 
0. Click `Duplicate`
0. Share it with your teammate, Ms. Brown *(eqbrown@isf.edu.hk)*, and Ms. Genzlinger *(bgenzlinger@isf.edu.hk)*

üñå **You and your teammate must work together to plan the frontend and backend of your social computing web app.**
- For the frontend, 
    - you must design a high-fidelity wireframe for each page of your site. It should look as close to your final design as possible. *([Inspiration for high-fidelity wireframes](https://dribbble.com/shots/popular/web-design))*
- For the backend, 
    - you must design the Model and Views of your app.

üîç **A few resources:** 
- [Django Model Field Types](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/models/fields/#field-types)
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- [Fontjoy](https://fontjoy.com/) - generates font combinations
- [coolors generator](https://coolors.co/generate)
- [google color picker](https://g.co/kgs/aHdDB9)
- [dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/popular/web-design)

## [2] Pitch Presentation

You will take your polished wireframes and you great web app idea and present it to your peers, teachers, and guests. After your presentation, the audience should understand what your app does, what features it has, and who will use it when it's finished. This is a valuable opportunity to pitch your idea and receive feedback.

{{< look-action >}} **You can find the slides template in your Google Drive.** Choose which of your team member's slides to use and notify a teacher.

Your pitch should include: 
- a short description of your idea
- what features your app will have
- images of your wireframes
