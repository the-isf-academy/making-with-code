## [0] Wireframe Design

üé®  **In this lab you will design a `wireframe` for the Ocean Park Water Park.** A `wireframe` is a layout design for a website.

‚úèÔ∏è **First, complete the wireframe design document.** 


üíª **Second, exchange wireframe design documents and implement your partners design in `HTML` and `CSS`.** This will require you to write `CSS` rules for various HTML elements. You may even want to implement `class` and `id` selectors for layout components and finer tuning of aesthetic design.

## [0] CSS Mini-intro

`CSS` allows you define design specifications for `HTML` elements. 

**For example, take this simple example:** `<h1>Hello, World</h1>`

**To change all `<h1>` tags to pink and underlined, all I need to do is write a simple rule in `styles.css`.**

<h1 class="css_intro">Hello, World</h1>



```css
h1{
  color: pink;
  text-decoration: underline;
}
```

üí° **You can write as many *rules* for CSS tags as you need for your design.**

üåê **There are SO many CSS properties, you do not need to memorize them. Instead,  Google and reference documentation.**
