## [0] Project Overview

üé® **Design Brief:** In this project, you must create a personal website to showcase yourself. It is up to you to decide how to best express yourself and implement that vision. 

It should include at least one of the following:

- personal achievements *(e.g. academic, athletic, artistic, etc.)*
- hobbies and/or interests *(e.g. culture you identify with: games, movies, music, art, etc. )*
- examples/links to personal projects *(e.g. artwork, photography, music, writing, recipes)*
- a portrait of yourself *(e.g. photography, drawing, cartoon, etc.)*


**Your personal website must include:**
- `.html` files
    - `index.html` homepage
- `styles.css` file
- `media`
    - this may include images or videos to showcase yourself or your work
    - you may include these in `/assets` or link them via the web
- `README.md` - here you will keep a works cited list with a short description of how you used the resource

You may use and adapt code you find online. However, you must keep track of the resources you used with a short description of how you used it. We will not help you debug huge lines of code you find online and do not understand.

## [1] Design Specification


‚úèÔ∏è **You will use a miro board to plan your website before you build it. The purpose of this board is to outline your design specifications and justify any changes to the design over time.** Your miro board will include:

- **inspiration**: screenshots of other sites or design elements, including explanations of how you would like to emulate them on your site
- **wireframe**: a high-fidelity wireframe of your website, including both a desktop and mobile layout
- **color palette**: including which specific shades your will use, and an explanation for why you choose them
- **font(s)**: including an explanation for why you choose them

If your design specs change over time, that's okay! Just be sure to document what you changed and why you changed it on your Miro board

## [2] Starter Code

You have the option of hosting your site online using Github pages. Because of this, you will need to create a new repository from a *template* of  the repository into your personal Github account. 

{{< code-action "Follow along with the teacher to ensure you properly create a template of the repository: " >}} [https://github.com/the-isf-academy/emmaqbrown.github.io](https://github.com/the-isf-academy/emmaqbrown.github.io).
> - Select `Use this template`
> - Select `Create a new repository`
> - Name the repository: `yourgithubusername.github.io` *(e.g. emmaqbrown.github.io)*
> - Select `Private` or `Public` (if you want your site to be live on the web, it must be `Public`)
> - Select `Create repository from template`

{{< code-action "Add the teachers to your  personal repository as a collaborators." >}}
> - Select `Settings`
> - Select `Collaborators and teams`
> - Selected `Add people`
> - Add `emmaqbrown` and `brittegenzlinger` as Admin

{{< code-action "Clone the repository into your" >}} `cs10/unit01_webdesign` folder. 

üëÄ **The repository contains the following:**
- `index.html`
- `page1.html` - this is an optional extra page. you should rename or delete this file
- `styles.css`
- `/assets` - you should put in photos into folder 
- `README.md` - keep this up to date with the resources you reference

üåê **If you would like for your project to be live on the web, you must activate Github pages**. Every time you push your Github, it will automatically push your website live to: `yourgithubername.github.io`. For example, mine is hosted at:[https://emmaqbrown.github.io/](https://emmaqbrown.github.io/).
> - Select `Settings` on the repo page
> - Select `Pages` on the left sidebar
> - Select `Branch` > `main` > `Save`

## [5] Resources

üîç **Google is your best friend!** Especially when it comes to Web Design, it's not about remembering exact HTML syntax or hundreds of specific CSS properties. It's about coming up with a design and figuring out how to implement it by looking at examples and modifying existing code.
